# About the Project
This project was developed as part of the requirements for our [CS 132 (Data Science)](https://dcs.upd.edu.ph/academics/undergraduate-program/) course at the University of the Philippines Diliman. Under the supervision and guidance of [Dr. Paul Rossener Regonia](https://scholar.google.com.ph/citations?user=Sh7e31UAAAAJ&hl=en), we synthesized our learnings from the event *Watch The Facts: A Mini-conference on Data Science and Disinformation in the Philippines*, held at Melchor Hall, UP Diliman on June 24, 2023.

## Results
The results show how the recent events established a connection with the Aquinos, which in turn, **increased the volume of allegation tweets** against them. As the Monthly SVR and Linear Regression Model showed that the allegation tweets increased linearly in time, implying a significant increase in twitter users who contribute to the influx of mis/disinformation.

Identified peak events turned to be dates of relevant events like People Power Revolution Anniversary, Ninoy Aquino Day, Cory Aquinoâ€™s Birthday, and 2022 National Elections. Thus, these are the top contributors to the volume of allegation tweets.

This calls for a **more rigorous and extensive fact-checking**, especially during these important events that reflect our political views, not just as individuals, but our decisions as a democratic country. We should be more vigilant as the battle against mis/disinformation will never end. However, as long as journalists, data scientists, and we exist, we will do whatever it takes for truth to prevail against this sea of mis/disinformation.
